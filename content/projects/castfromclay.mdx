This website stands out with its impressive design and user experience, and as a Lead Developer during my time there, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of various key elements, ensuring their high quality and seamless functionality.

One notable feature that sets the Cast From Clay website apart is the implementation of intricate SVG animations on the homepage. These animations add a dynamic and visually captivating element to the website, creating an engaging first impression.

The [Services page](https://castfromclay.co.uk/services/) is another highlight, featuring custom animations that enhance the overall user experience. These animations bring the services offered by the company to life, making them more engaging and memorable.

Additionally, the website boasts a unique [landing page](https://castfromclay.co.uk/big-picture/experts-age-of-instinct-uk/) design with horizontal scrolling, specifically designed to showcase research details. This creative approach provides a seamless and interactive way for users to explore and absorb information.

Overall, the Cast From Clay website demonstrates a strong emphasis on aesthetics and user experience. The attention to detail, intricate animations, and intuitive design create an immersive browsing experience, leaving a lasting impression on visitors.

As the Lead Developer, I dedicated myself to ensuring that every aspect of the website met our high standards of quality and functionality.
