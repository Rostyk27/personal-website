This website stands out with its impressive design and user experience. As a Lead Developer, I've contributed to the development of various key elements.

One notable feature is the implementation of complex SVG animations on the homepage. These animations add a dynamic and visually captivating element to the website, creating an engaging first impression.

The [Services page](https://castfromclay.co.uk/services/) is another highlight, featuring custom animations that enhance the overall user experience. These animations bring the services offered by the company to life, making them more engaging and memorable.

Additionally, the website boasts a unique [landing page](https://castfromclay.co.uk/big-picture/experts-age-of-instinct-uk/) design with horizontal scrolling, specifically designed to showcase research details. This creative approach provides a seamless and interactive way for users to explore and absorb information.

Overall, the Cast From Clay website demonstrates a strong emphasis on aesthetics and user experience. The attention to detail, intricate animations, and intuitive design create an immersive browsing experience, leaving a lasting impression on visitors.

As the Lead Developer, I strived to ensure every aspect of the website met our high standards.
