This is a simple grid system designed to facilitate the creation of responsive layouts with columns on websites. The grid system is based on a 12-column structure and utilizes the CSS property `display: flex` to achieve its functionality.

The grid system simplifies the process of creating responsive designs by automatically adjusting the column widths based on the screen size. This ensures that the website maintains its layout integrity and readability across different devices and viewport sizes.

This grid provides a straightforward and intuitive solution for building column-based layouts, making it a valuable tool for web development projects.
