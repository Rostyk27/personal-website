Key features of the project include a robust product search functionality, allowing users to easily find specific items. The website also offers advanced filtering and sorting options, empowering users to refine their product selection based on their preferences. Pagination is implemented to handle large product catalogs efficiently.

Next.js Shop enables users to add products to their cart, manage the contents of the cart, and simulate the ordering process. The cart management functionality ensures an intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to review and modify their selections.

Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean and maintainable code, adhering to TypeScript best practices. The project's architecture and implementation align with industry standards and leverage the powerful features of Next.js 13.

Please note that Next.js Shop is a personal project developed for demonstration purposes and does not involve real product inventory or payment processing.
