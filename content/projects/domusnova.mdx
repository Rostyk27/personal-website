I led the development of the Domus Nova website during my time at [Cast From Clay](https://castfromclay.co.uk/). The website was developed using a WordPress custom starter theme which was built from scratch. The project prioritized delivering a visually stunning and intuitive UI/UX experience to engage and captivate users.

One of the standout features of the website is its superior performance optimization, ensuring fast loading times and a smooth browsing experience. Through careful optimization techniques, we achieved optimal page load speeds, enhancing user satisfaction and search engine visibility.

The property [filtering system](https://domusnova.com/london-sales/) on the website offers an exceptional user experience. With advanced filtering options, users can easily narrow down their search based on various criteria such as location, price range, property type, and amenities. This robust filtering functionality simplifies the property search process and helps users find their ideal luxury home in London or Ibiza effortlessly.

A custom [multi-step form](https://domusnova.com/contact/) was implemented to enhance the user experience when contacting the agency. The form guides users through a smooth and engaging process, collecting necessary information while maintaining a visually appealing design. The integration of various systems, such as HubSpot and Mailchimp, streamlined the agency's marketing and communication efforts.

Throughout the project, collaboration with designers and close communication with the client was paramount. By working closely with the design agency, we ensured seamless integration of aesthetics and functionality. Regular client interactions allowed us to understand their requirements fully and deliver a website that exceeded their expectations.

In summary, the Domus Nova luxury estate website is a testament to our dedication to delivering a top-tier user experience. From the quality UI/UX design and performance optimization to the robust property filtering system, intuitive IA, custom multi-step form, and seamless integration with various systems, every aspect of the website was meticulously crafted to provide an exceptional user journey. Working in collaboration with the design agency and the client, we created a website that truly represents the elegance of Domus Nova's luxury properties.
