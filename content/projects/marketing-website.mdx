This is a marketing website built with **Next.js** using server components for optimized server-side rendering and seamless performance. Developed with **TypeScript**, the project maintains a scalable and reliable codebase, enhancing both the development process and long-term maintenance.

The content is managed through **DatoCMS**, a powerful headless CMS, where data is fetched using **GraphQL** via **Apollo Client**, allowing for fast and efficient content delivery. This setup keeps the site's content up-to-date and relevant, making it easy to showcase the latest product features and solutions.

The user interface is built using **Tailwind CSS**, providing a fully responsive design that looks great across all devices. Form submissions, such as demo requests or contact inquiries, are handled with **React Hook Form** combined with **Zod** for strong form validation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

In addition to its modern tech stack, the project prioritizes performance and accessibility. It delivers excellent speed and adheres to web accessibility standards, enhancing a user-friendly experience for all visitors.
