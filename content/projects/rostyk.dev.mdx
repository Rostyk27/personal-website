My personal website is a space where I share my experience and skills in development, showcasing some of my projects and expertise in web development.

If you appreciate the design, please check out the author's repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com) from where this website was cloned.

It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Upstash](https://upstash.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
