The client had a specific requirement to ensure the website's accessibility, and this aspect was given utmost importance during development. The website was designed and implemented following web accessibility guidelines, making it inclusive and usable for all users.

The website's visually captivating and distinctive design draws inspiration from the ocean, aligning with the company's mission to promote healthy, equitable, and sustainable food systems through its work with Blue Foods and the waters in which they grow. By incorporating elements, colors, and imagery that evoke a sense of the sea, the design creates an immersive and engaging experience for visitors.

Great emphasis was placed on optimizing the website's performance to ensure a fast and seamless user experience. Techniques such as minification of CSS and JavaScript files, image optimization, lazy loading, and caching were implemented to reduce loading times and improve overall performance. The website's smooth navigation and quick response contribute to a positive user experience. It was a project that I had the opportunity to work on during my time at [Cast From Clay](https://castfromclay.co.uk/).
