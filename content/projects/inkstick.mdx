Inkstick Media places a strong emphasis on accessibility and user experience. The website features a multifaceted menu that goes beyond a simple navigation tool. In addition to providing links to various topics, the menu dynamically displays the latest posts, enabling visitors to stay up to date with the freshest content. Furthermore, the menu incorporates a powerful search functionality and intuitive filtering options, allowing users to effortlessly find specific posts based on their interests.

The website showcases a stunning custom logo animation, adding an element of visual delight to the homepage. This animation adds a visually engaging element, capturing the attention of visitors and leaving a lasting impression. Additionally, Inkstick Media implements a robust post-filtering system across different categories, topics, [locations](https://inkstickmedia.com/location/ukraine/), and date archive pages. The filtering system enhances the user experience by providing a seamless and efficient way to navigate and discover relevant content.

The website's elegant and minimalist design further enhances the overall aesthetic appeal. The carefully chosen design elements, refined typography, and balanced use of whitespace contribute to a clean and modern look. It's worth mentioning that I had the privilege of contributing to this project during my time at [Cast From Clay](https://castfromclay.co.uk/) as a Lead Front-end/WordPress Developer.
