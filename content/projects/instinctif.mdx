Instinctif.com is a multilingual website that offers content in English, German, and Arabic, catering to a diverse international audience. The seamless implementation of multiple languages ensures that users can access the website in their preferred language, enhancing their browsing experience and facilitating effective communication.

One standout feature of the website is its ability to deliver relevant content based on the user's selected location. This personalized approach allows users to access posts, updates, and other relevant information specific to their chosen location, creating a tailored experience and fostering a deeper connection with the brand.

The website incorporates a fullscreen mega menu that adheres to web accessibility standards. The thoughtful implementation of web accessibility enhances inclusivity and ensures that the website is accessible to a wide range of individuals.

In terms of design, Instinctif.com features a modern and expansive layout, complemented by visually appealing animations. The animations add an engaging and dynamic element to the browsing experience, capturing the attention of visitors and creating a memorable impression.

Lastly, it's important to note that I was involved in the development of this project during my time at [Cast From Clay](https://castfromclay.co.uk/), contributing to the implementation of various key elements.
