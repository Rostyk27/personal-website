Todo App is a lightweight pet project developed on React, designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. This application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, providing a seamless and intuitive user interface.

As my first project on React, Todo App served as a valuable learning experience to understand the fundamentals of React's component-based architecture, state management, and rendering mechanisms. Despite its simplicity, the project demonstrates the my understanding of React's core concepts and their ability to apply them to create functional and interactive web applications.

Please note that Todo App is a personal project developed for learning purposes and does not involve backend integration or persistent data storage.
